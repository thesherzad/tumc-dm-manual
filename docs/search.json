    "section": "Interface overview",
    "text": "Interface overview\nIn this section we explore different parts of the database interface.\n\nAfter you’ve logged in, on the far top-right corner of the page, you’ll a circle icon, when you click on it, it’ll tell what’s your username and what email your account is bound to. While you can click on the “Account Settings” and change some fields - but it’s not recommended to do it, if you feel something needs to be changed, please consult with Admin.\n\nOn the left side bar you’ll see a few options, but the one you’ll need to use is the “Deployed”. It means deployed projects/forms. When you click on it, it’ll show which forms you have access to. The form names are indicative of what they are for. Click on the one you need to work on. If it happens that you don’t see the “Deployed” option, click on the check-list icon (on the left side of big blue button).\n\nWhile you’ve access to creating new form (Blue button with “NEW” text on it), but you don’t need to create and it won’t be used. That’s what admin will deal with. The Draft, means drafted projects are there, and same for Archived, archived projects live there - but you don’t need to bother yourself with them :). Admin user can use the “NEW” button to initiate a new project/form, it’ll ask to upload either build or upload a form. For further details, please visit KOBO’s official documentation here.\nSUMMARY: when you click on a form, it’ll take you to a more busier page where you can see the information about the form, like last time the form was updated, or who owns/control the form, or a graphical summary of data collection. On the right side of the page, there are some buttons, but they are just for easy to access, we will explore them in their own section.\nFORM: this is where you can open a form to start data entry, update/replace the form or deploy. If you update or deploy the form you should have trained to do so and here’s a link to detailed documentation. For data entry purposes, click on the “Open” button in the lower-right side of the page, it’ll take you to the data entry form. You might be asked to enter your username and password, if so, use your username and password that you used to log-in to the system.\n\nThe data entry form is explained in Data Entry Form section below.\nDATA: under this tab, you can view and manage (if you’re authorized) the data. Below, we explore each feature in detail:\n\nTable: it’s at the top of the side bar. This is the default view, where you can see the data in a tabular format. There’s a search bar for every column, use that to search for your desired record. There’s also a drop down where you can sort, hide or freeze a column - this might not be visible for all users.\n\n\nCheck icon: if you see this icon, that’s for bulk edit or delete. Select single or multiple columns and you’ll have some options displayed at the top of the table, where you can edit or delete all the selected rows. There’s a another Check icon at the table header level, if you check that, it’ll apply the action (edit/delete) on all of the records in that page.\nEye icon: it lets you to view each record individually in a long format with detailed column labels.\nPen icon: it lets you to edit a record. This might not be visible for all users.\n\nReports: this feature is not useful in our case. But it provides a basic summary stats about the table.\nGallery: same as report, not useful in our case. If we’d collect images, this would be helpful.\nDownloads: this is where you can download the data into different formats such as csv, excel and etc. Some useful options here:\n\n\nExport type: choose the format you want to download the data. Excel would be the most useful format in our case.\nVale and header format: if you want long descriptive labels as column name in downloaded data, so choose “Labels”, the default is short names.\nUnder “Advanced options”: most of the time the default option works, but one useful feature is to select specific columns (questions) to be exported. For example you might need only first name and last name wit id, so you can choose only.\nExport: after you have chosen your preference for the downloaded file, click on the “Export” button, it’ll take a few seconds and create your downloadable in the table underneath it.\nDownload: lets you download the exported data. If you just exported, your downloadable file is the very top record, so click on the “Download” button and it’ll store it on your computer.\n\nMap: since we’re not collecting spatial data (GPS points) this is not useful in our case.\n\nSETTINGS: this is the project settings, so mostly for admin uses only - and it might be disabled to unauthorized users. Admin can share a project with a user from settings tab or change the existing sharing setting. Other menu items are not covered in this manual, but can be found here.\n\n\nSharing: this page lets you to share the current form with other users. click on the “Add user” button, it’ll let you to type in the username and assign the permission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease do not share the projects unless you’re sure of username and confident that you know what you’re doing - you might share the personal information with someone accidentally.\nAlso, never give “Delete” or “Manage project” permission to any user other than the admin.\n\n\nEdit or remove the existing sharing setting: click on the pen icon to update the permission. Or click on the trash icon to remove accessibility for that user for the current project/form.\nYou can allow submissions to the form without username and password. This is not recommended, but if we plan to let self-sign up (specifically for Tuesdays distribution), this will be needed. By switching on the toggle, the form will be accessible by a link to everyone.\nAlso, the form can be shared publicly - which MUST NOT be. But in certain cases you might need to share the form temporarily with someone, so use these options to do so. For example, for printing ESOL name tags, we need turn on the “Anyone can view submissions made to this form” temporarily, but it needs to be turned off right after the print is done.\n\n\n\nData Entry Form\nData entry is one of the most used feature if this system. We use it to enter data from distributions, appointments, ESOL attendance and so on. Following, we’ll cover some potential behaviors that might face with:\n\nLogin: If it’s your first time doing data entry, you’ll be asked to enter your username and password. use your KOBO username/password to login. If you trust on the device, I’d recommend to save the username and password (if you’re asked to save), so next time you won’t need to log-in again.\nUnsaved Record Found: If you previously used a form to enter data and left the page without submitting it, you most likely will be asked to either DISCARD or LOAD RECORD. The former one will start a new form. The latter one will reload the previous data and resume data entry where you left off.\n\nA new version available: you may see an orange box at the top of the page that notifies about an updated form. If that happens, it’s recommended to refresh the page, and you’ll have the update in the form. Once the forms are stable, this may not happen.\nDraft/Submit: you’ve the option to save your date temporarily and resume later by clicking on the “Save Draft” button. If you’re done entering the data, click on “Submit” button to submit the data to the database.\nOffline data collection: this form works perfectly fine collecting data when you don’t have internet, once the internet connection is detected, it’ll submit the saved data by itself."

E.g. Choose the desired date range, and then select the desired service. The resulting graph and table will be based on that filter.\n\n\nAppointment Calendar: it can be helpful to show you how many appointments you should expect for certain day, and time slot.\nAppointment Details: this table view is helpful if you want to download or view your desired appointments in more details, e.g. date, time slots and such."

Your csv file’s header must match this when you open it with MS Excel, you’ll get error otherwise.\n\n\nIt’s okay if the date in cell B1, and values in D3, E3 are different.
